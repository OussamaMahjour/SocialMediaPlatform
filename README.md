**Educational project** demonstrating a social media platform built with Spring Boot microservices. Currently in active development.

## üìå Overview

A learning-focused implementation featuring:
- JWT-based authentication 
- Caching with Redis
- Microservices cloud  architecture 
- Event-driven architecture with Kafka
- Containerized services and orchestration  using Docker and kubernetes
- CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Services

**Implemented:**
- **User Service**: Account management & profiles
- **![Auth Service](services/auth-service/README.md)**: Users Registration and JWT token generation
-  **![Chat Service](servies/chat-service/README.md)**:Message and Video/Voice calls
- **Post Service**: Content creation & management
- **Config Service**: Centralized configuration
- **Discovery Service**: Service registration
- **Gateway**: API routing & load balancing
- **Media Service**: File storage (MinIO)

**In Development:**
- **Message Service** (direct messaging)
- **Notification Service** (real-time alerts and notification )

## üîß Tech Stack

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose (local development)
- Kubernetes (production deployment - WIP)
- AWS EC2 (future hosting)

**Data Stores:**
- MySQL (relational data)
- MongoDB (NoSQL data)
- Redis (caching)
- MinIO (object storage)

**Communication:**
- HTTP/REST for external APIs
- Kafka for event streaming
